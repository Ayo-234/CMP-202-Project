# Simple Interest Calculator

## Overview
This project is a Simple Interest Calculator developed in Java. It uses a graphical user interface (GUI) created with Swing to interact with the user. The program calculates the simple interest based on user inputs: principal amount, rate of interest, and time period.

## Main Components
- `SimpleInterestCalculator` class: Contains the entire logic for the GUI, input validation, interest calculation, and file saving.
- GUI components: Created using Swing for a user-friendly interface.

## Input Validation
- The program checks if the inputs are valid numbers and greater than zero.
- If the inputs are invalid, appropriate error messages are displayed to the user.

## File Saving
- The calculated interest along with the input values are saved to a file named "interest_result.txt".
- 

##Implementation 
1. Enter the principal amount, rate of interest, and time period in the respective fields.
2. Click the "Calculate" button.
3. The calculated interest will be displayed on the GUI and in a dialog box.
4. The result will be saved in interest_result.txt.
