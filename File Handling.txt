Algorithm of File Handling part of the code
Tasks:
- Implement the logic to save results to a text file.
- Ensure the file is created and written correctly.
- Handle any potential IO exceptions and display error messages.

Code:
void saveResultToFile(double principal, double rate, double time, double interest) {
    try (FileWriter writer = new FileWriter("interest_result.txt")) {
        writer.write("Principal: ₦" + principal + "\n");
        writer.write("Rate: " + rate + "%" + "\n");
        writer.write("Time: " + time + "yrs" + "\n");
        writer.write("Interest: ₦" + interest + "\n");
    } catch (IOException e) {
        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Error saving result to file.");
    }
}
